# GNNs to identify novel inhibitors of the human EGFR kinase protein
In this project, we explore virtual screening using ML and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify novel inhibitors of the EGFR protein. We will develop predictive models using molecular fingerprints and graph-based representations, leveraging PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and Scikit-learn. 
The ultimate objective is to screen a small commercial library and select 100 promising and diverse molecules with molecular weight between 280 and 400 Da for further experimental investigation.
